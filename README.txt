## The rules of Scrabble are as follows:

1. The game board consists of a 15x15 grid of squares.
2. Players take turns creating words on the board using their tiles.
3. Each player starts with seven tiles and must use these tiles to create words.
4. Each tile has a point value, and the score for each word is calculated by adding up the point values of each tile in the word.
5. Some squares on the board have special properties, such as double or triple letter scores, or double or triple word scores. If a tile is placed on one of these squares, the score for the word is multiplied by the corresponding value.
6. Players can challenge the validity of a word played by their opponent. If the word is not found in the official Scrabble dictionary, it is removed from the board and the player loses their turn.
7. The game ends when all tiles have been played and one player has used all of their tiles, or when all players have passed their turn twice in a row. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
